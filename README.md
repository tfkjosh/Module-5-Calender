## Description

This website is designed for an application that an employee can use to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Installation

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab on the right side of the repository's page.

4. From the settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `lernantino` and the project is `css-demo-site`, your URL would be `lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site`)

## Usage
